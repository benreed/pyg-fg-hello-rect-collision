Tuple member legend:
   [0]     : Pseudo-key naming frame (used to make a real key)
   [1]     : Drawing axis : Delineates what space is considered
             "in front of" or "behind" the character when facing
			 left or right
   [2]     : Sprite collision rect : Used to determine collision 
             with surfaces and other sprites, e.g.:
		     * Keeps sprites from clipping thru walls, ceiling, floor
		     * Determines how deep sprites can clip into each other
		     * In advanced hit states, may determine if character hits 
		     a surface and is subject to a splat, knockdown, etc
			 (this day is yet far off...)
   [3...n] : Vulnerability and attack collision rects : Of indeterminate 
             number. Most frames have at least 1 "Vuln" rect, 
			 but only specific frames will have 1 or more "Atk" rects.
